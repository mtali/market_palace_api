# INTRODUCTION
I did this project as a tutorial for building my own rails API specifically for
android client applications.
The tutorial can be found at the following link

# Ruby version
> 2.3.1

# Rails version
> 5.1.3

# Running test suites
`bundle exec rspec`

# Need help
I will always be grateful to hear from other rails developers out there.
